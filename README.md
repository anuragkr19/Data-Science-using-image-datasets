# Image Analysis
Developed an image analysis data science project to predict the type of fruit using image dataset.Collected  80 close-up images of 4 different types of fruits. Performed dimensionality reduction and resizing of images before feeding into machine learning models,created using scikit-learn libraries. Machine Learning models developed are SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network classifiers. 

Technology used:- Python,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Scikit-Learn
